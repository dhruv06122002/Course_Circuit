                        <h3>DATABASE</h3>
                        <p align="justify">A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system. A database is usually controlled by a database management system (DBMS). Together, the data and the DBMS, along with the applications that are associated with them, are referred to as a database system, often shortened to just database.</p>

							<h3>What is Structured Query Language (SQL)?</h3>
SQL is a programming language used by nearly all relational databases to query, manipulate, and define data, and to provide access control. SQL was first developed at IBM in the 1970s with Oracle as a major contributor, which led to implementation of the SQL ANSI standard, SQL has spurred many extensions from companies such as IBM, Oracle, and Microsoft. Although SQL is still widely used today, new programming languages are beginning to appear.

                            <h3>Types of databases</h3>
There are many different types of databases. The best database for a specific organization depends on how the organization intends to use the data.
<ul>
<li><b>Relational databases.</b></li> Relational databases became dominant in the 1980s. Items in a relational database are organized as a set of tables with columns and rows. Relational database technology provides the most efficient and flexible way to access structured information.
<li><b>Object-oriented databases.</b></li>  Information in an object-oriented database is represented in the form of objects, as in object-oriented programming.
<li><b>Distributed databases.</b></li> A distributed database consists of two or more files located in different sites. The database may be stored on multiple computers, located in the same physical location, or scattered over different networks.
<li><b>Data warehouses.</b></li> A central repository for data, a data warehouse is a type of database specifically designed for fast query and analysis.
<li><b>NoSQL databases.</b></li> A NoSQL, or nonrelational database, allows unstructured and semistructured data to be stored and manipulated (in contrast to a relational database, which defines how all data inserted into the database must be composed). NoSQL databases grew popular as web applications became more common and more complex.
<li><b>Graph databases.</b></li> A graph database stores data in terms of entities and the relationships between entities.
<li><b>OLTP databases.</b></li> An OLTP database is a speedy, analytic database designed for large numbers of transactions performed by multiple users.
<li><b>Open source databases.</b></li> An open source database system is one whose source code is open source; such databases could be SQL or NoSQL databases.
<li><b>Cloud databases.</b></li> A cloud database is a collection of data, either structured or unstructured, that resides on a private, public, or hybrid cloud computing platform. There are two types of cloud database models: traditional and database as a service (DBaaS). With DBaaS, administrative tasks and maintenance are performed by a service provider.
<li><b>Multimodel database.</b></li> Multimodel databases combine different types of database models into a single, integrated back end. This means they can accommodate various data types.
<li><b>Document/JSON database.</b></li> Designed for storing, retrieving, and managing document-oriented information, document databases are a modern way to store data in JSON format rather than rows and columns.
<li><b>Self-driving databases.</b></li> The newest and most groundbreaking type of database, self-driving databases (also known as autonomous databases) are cloud-based and use machine learning to automate database tuning, security, backups, updates, and other routine management tasks traditionally performed by database administrators.
