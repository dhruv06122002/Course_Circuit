							<p align="justify">	 
							<ul>
							<li>Unlike static HTML sites which can be hosted on most web servers, when it comes to web applications, there are basically two types of hosting platforms. Depending on your hosting needs and what you’re most comfortable with, you can choose from:Linux Hosting, which allows running scripts written in PHP, Perl, Python and other Unix-originated languages, and usually supports PostgreSQL and MySQL databases. 
							</li>
							<li>This is the most commonly used system today. Windows Hosting, which allows running ASP scripts utilizing .NET and other Microsoft technologies, and supports Microsoft SQL Server and Access database.</li>
							<li> You can go with either Linux hosting or Windows hosting, regardless of which operating system you use at home or at work. If your website doesn’t require any scripting support, you’ll find Linux hosting more cost-effective. But if your website needs scripting and database support, choose the platform that supports the technologies you use.</li>

						<tr>
							<td colspan="2"><h3>Some Factors To Consider Before You Choose Web Hosting Company</h3></td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td><b>What suits you?</b></td>
							<td align="justify">Before choosing a web hosting plan, you need to know on what platform are you going to develop your website. If it is already developed then which platform is best suited for it. For example, if your website is developed on ASP language, you would need to go with a Windows Hosting plan and choose the Web Host specializing in Windows Hosting. In the same way, if your website is developed on PHP language, you can prefer a Linux Hosting plan which would be the best platform for PHP.</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td><b>What is Costing?</b></td>
							<td align="justify">Price is always the first factor that you look for while you choose a web host. But before anyone pays for it one must decide what exactly one is paying for. Jumping on to the cheapest offer is definitely not worth an idea. The easiest way is to select a few web hosts, jot down their various offerings in terms of features and then tick marking the ones you really need for the website. </td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td><b>What plan do you require?</b></td>
							<td align="justify">Make sure you know what web host plan that best suits you. There are Monthly/Quarterly/Annual Payment Plans to choose from. At times when you are having a start-up and you would like to try out a new web host each month, a monthly plan works out the best. </td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td><b>Capabilities: </b></td>
							<td align="justify">Price is always the first factor that you look for while you choose a web host. But before anyone pays for it one must decide what exactly one is paying for. Jumping on to the cheapest offer is definitely not worth an idea. </td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td><b>What is Costing?</b></td>
							<td align="justify"><ul>
								<li>24/7 – Round the Clock Service Support</li>
								<li>Secure FTP Access</li>
								<li>The number of email accounts</li>
								<li>Hosting Control Panel</li>
								<li>Online traffic statistics</li>
								<li>Fine, robust database management system</li>
							</ul></td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td><b>Multiple Domain Hosting and Subdomains: </b></td>
							<td align="justify">If you have multiple websites to host, make sure your web host supports multiple domains. Is the amount that they are charging worth the number of domains and services? Are they going to charge more for multiple domain usages? Is there an asterisk mark on the pricing tag? Ask for it.</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td><b>Server Speed and Security:</b></td>
							<td align="justify">The Web host should be reliable and fast. How can one ensure this? Look for a minimum uptime SLA with 99%. A good Web host will provide an uptime SLA that is 99.5% higher. Ask the Web Host for a tool with which you can check the TTL and latency from your current location to the server which will give an idea of how far is your server from your region.</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td><b>Formula you decide on monthly website data transfer:</b></td>
							<td align="justify">Never go for a cheapest hosting package. Data transfer is also referred to as “traffic” or “bandwidth”. It is the number of bytes transferred from your site to visitors when they browse your site. You got to ensure fast page loads. You also need to confirm with the Web Host about the storage capacity: Memory and the number of client accounts hosted on that server to make sure your account is not on an overloaded server.</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td><b>Disk Space: </b></td>
							<td align="justify">Twisting language to lure customers is a passé. There is nothing like unlimited space plans for web hosting. New site requires a Disk Space of something less than 20 MB. For some number of pages like 100 – 500 you don’t need 100 GB space. You can do with something like 20 MB.</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td><b>Technical Support:</b></td>
							<td align="justify">Technical Support functions 24 Hours a day, 7 Days a week and all-round the year. Test your web host by emailing/ticketing or initiating chat support on a random time like the mid-night and see if they respond to you.
							<br>“Your product or service decides what kind of web host you require. Express more on what your business is about with your Web Hosting Company and let your product or service decide!”</td>
